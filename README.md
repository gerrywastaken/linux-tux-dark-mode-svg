# linux-tux-dark-mode-svg
I didn't see anybody else with a dark mode svg of tux. I want to see Anthropic and OpenAI and others have no excuses about not having anthing to display for Linux downloads on when the page is using dark mode. The same logo svg also works for light mode if you aren't fussy about the invisible border, which may require you to make it a bit biggerin light mode.

Here is the image:
